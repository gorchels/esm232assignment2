```

##Installing Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Background information for Almonds 
```{r}
prod_life = 22 #Productive life (22-25 years)
first_harv = 3 #First harvest (age in years)
full_prod = 6 #Full production (age in years)
area_change = 69 #Area change 1980–2003 (%)
yield_change = 57 #Yield change 1980–2003 (%)
avg_yield = 0.9 #Average yields 2000–2003 (ton acre"1)
```

## Parameters for yield anomoly
```{r}
#Tmf is the mimimum temperature in the month two months before harvest (Ferbuary)
#Pm is the total Precipitation in the month before harvest (March)

march_mm = 12
min_T_Feb = 8
```

## Read in data 

```{r}
climate = read_csv("climate.csv")

```

##Wrangle dataset to work as model input 

```{r}
climate_sum = climate %>% 
  group_by(year,month) %>% 
  summarise(min_T = min(tmin_c),
            precip = sum(precip)) %>% 
  filter(month== 3 | month==2)

climate_temp = climate_sum %>% 
  filter(month==2)

climate_precip = climate_sum %>% 
  filter(month==3)

climate_join = right_join(climate_precip,climate_temp, by="year")

climate_input = climate_join %>% 
  select(year, precip.x, min_T.y)
#This is my model input. The precip.x is the precipitation in march and the min_T.y minimum temperature in February
```
